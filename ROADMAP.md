### UX Requirements

* Visible delete actions where appropriate
* Clean, readable weekly layout

---

## Roadmap

* Weekly board UI
* Drag & drop for chores/events
* Basic toast notifications

---

### Phase 1.3 — AI Assistant (DONE ✅)
**Intelligent task assignment and planning**

#### Features Completed:
* **Smart Chore Assignment:**
   * Analyzes family member roles and workload
   * Generates fair chore distribution suggestions
   * Shows reasoning for each assignment
   * One-click accept & assign functionality

---

### Phase 1.5 — Stabilization / Consistency (DONE ✅)
**Lock the schema + routes + UI into a consistent model**

#### Prisma
* Ensure schema.prisma contains ONLY Prisma schema (no JS/CSS fragments)
* Confirm Event fields are correct: startsAt, endsAt, optional metadata fields
* Confirm enums align with UI and route:
   * EventType
   * EventCategory (if used)
* Remove / reconcile any partial migration folders (e.g. blank timestamp folders)

#### API
* Confirm /api/schedule supports:
   * GET (optionally by date range)
   * POST (title + startsAt required, endsAt optional, validate endsAt > startsAt)
   * PATCH (partial updates, validate dates)
   * DELETE (by ?id=...)
* Confirm /api/chores supports expected PATCH updates (dueDay, completion)

#### UI
* Remove "Work hours" from Schedule page (work belongs on Member page)
* Confirm event delete button is visible and consistent everywhere

---

### Phase 2 — Events UX Upgrade (DONE ✅)
**Make events feel real (time + type + category presets)**

#### Event Form Requirements
* Event must support:
   * Start date
   * Start time
   * End time (optional but recommended)
* Add dropdown presets for common event types:
   * Doctor Appointment
   * Dentist Appointment
   * School Event
   * Practice
   * Game
   * Church
   * Family Event
   * Other (custom)
* Allow "Custom name" to override preset (or add details)
* Optional fields:
   * Location
   * Notes/description

#### Display Requirements (Week Board)
* Event card shows:
   * Time range (e.g. 4:30 PM–6:00 PM)
   * Title
   * Category badge
   * Location (optional)
* Clicking an event opens edit modal
* Delete icon/button visible on each event entry

---

### Phase 3 — Performance & Data Scoping (DONE ✅)
**Stop fetching entire history; fetch only what we need**

#### API improvements
* Update schedule GET to accept:
   * ?start=YYYY-MM-DD&end=YYYY-MM-DD
* Update Prisma query to filter by startsAt range
* Mirror same behavior for chores if needed (optional)

#### UI improvements
* Week navigation triggers range fetch
* Reduce client-side filtering

---

### Phase 4 — Work Hours on Member Page (DONE ✅)
**Move "Work Hours" into Family Members, not Schedule**

#### Data model
* Add workingHours (string or structured) to FamilyMember (already exists in schema)
* Create UI on member edit modal:
   * Example: Mon 9-5, Tue 9-5 ... (phase 1)
   * Future: structured per-day (phase 2)

#### Week board
* Show work blocks derived from member working hours (optional)
* Work display should be non-event "background" or separate "Work" block

---

### Phase 5 — Dashboard & Quality of Life (NICE TO HAVE ✅)
* /dashboard summary:
   * Today's events
   * Today's chores
   * Overdue chores
   * Weekly completion progress
* Better empty states and inline help tips
* Keyboard-friendly controls and accessibility checks

---

### Phase 6 — Recurrence System (ADVANCED)
**Choose one approach:**

#### Option A (Simple)
Store recurring as duplicated instances (limited range)
* **Pros:** simple
* **Cons:** can bloat DB

#### Option B (Best Practice)
Store recurrence rule, generate instances virtually per week
* **Pros:** clean DB
* **Cons:** more logic

**Decision pending.**

---

### Phase 7 — Auth & Multi-Family (FUTURE)
* Add authentication
* Each user has a familyId
* Invite spouse/family members
* Shared board per family

---

## Known Issues / Risks

* **Prisma enum migrations** in Postgres can fail if multiple values are added in one migration.
   * Preferred approach: split into multiple migrations or manually commit between changes if required.
* **Avoid placing ANY non-Prisma content in schema.prisma.**
* **Keep schedule GET scoped to week range** to prevent slow loads.
* **AI Assistant** requires valid ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in environment variables.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

A task is "Done" when:
* ✅ UI works on desktop and mobile
* ✅ API validates inputs
* ✅ DB schema is consistent
* ✅ No console errors
* ✅ Feature is reflected in this roadmap as checked ✅

---

## Notes for Contributors

* Prefer small PRs: 1 feature, 1 PR
* Keep UI consistent with existing styles
* Use optimistic UI patterns where possible
* Validate server-side even if UI validates
* Document new features in this roadmap
* Update navigation in HamburgerMenu.js when adding new pages
